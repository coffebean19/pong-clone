# Pong clone repository

A pong clone made using C++ and the Raylib library. The specific guide followed to create this clone was provided by user   `educ8s` on his youtube channel, on this specific video:

He also provided a starter template for Raylib and C++, which I did not use as it is made for Windows. 
Thus I created a makefile to compile and link the necessary headers and such.
The code provided as of today (31-12-2025) is as exactly as demonstrated in the guide, and therefore the code works without change on Debian 13. The only change would be in compiler.
